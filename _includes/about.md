_Long version:_ My name is Robin Scheibler and I am a researcher
focusing on data and signals.  My research interests have taken me from
[proving theorems](/sparse_hadamard) to literally jumping in a cold
mountain lake to [sample its water](/biodesign), checking for the presence
of arsenic. When I work on a problem, I want to take it from the idea all
the way to the implementation into a [physical prototype](/microphone_arrays).

Currently, I live in [Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo)
and work at [Google Deepmind](https://deepmind.google/) on
neural audio processing for enhancement and separation.

Before that I worked on diffusion-based speech
[enhancement](https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2024/scheibler24_interspeech.html)
and [separation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17327), and [blind source separation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10048)
at [LINE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(software)) Corp. and later [LY Corp.](https://research.lycorp.co.jp/jp/publications) (i.e., LINEヤフー).

I am the main contributor to [Pyroomacoustics](https://github.com/LCAV/pyroomacoustics),
a Python package for room simulation and audio array processing. The
package lets the user easily create acoustic scenarios and simulate the
propagation between sources and microphones.

I got my B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. from [EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch) in
Switzerland. I was lucky enough to be a member of the awesome [Audiovisual
Communications Laboratory](http://lcav.epfl.ch) from 2012 to 2017.
Between 2017 and 2020, I was a post-doctoral research at [Ono Laboratory](https://www.comp.sd.tmu.ac.jp/onolab/index-e.html) working on the sound-to-light sensors: [Blinkies](/otohikari).
Before all that, I worked for NEC in Japan, and IBM Research in Switzerland.


In my free time, I like to create electronics gadgets. I am an early
member of SAFECAST Japan where I build mobile Geiger counters to
monitor the fallout from the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear accident. I
co-founded the [biodesign for the real-world](http://biodesign.cc) project.
